#STORYGRAPH SCRAPE 

This is a project to scrape ratings and reviews from the website Storygraph. Storygraph is a newer place for users to rate, review and track books read and books they want to read. It also provides recommendations. 
It's grown in popularity after goodreads was purchased by Amazon and support for a lot of their functionality has decreased. I know that Storygraph has a small team supporting their site and an API is in the plans
for the future. This code may potentially bridge the gap for users looking to use an API.

The Storygraph site has more extensive rating and reporting that a singular aggregated star rating
Other review categories:
-Moods
-Pace
-Plot- or character-driven?
-Strong character development?
-Loveable characters?
-Diverse cast of characters?
-Flaws of characters a main focus?

Some current limitations and things I plan to address: 
Error handling hasn't quite been built out 
Storygraph's URL isn't straightforward to recreate, so my code takes some stabs in the dark to get to the google storygraph review site. I don't know of a great way around this, I may track guids in the future but that is a part of a larger project.
I think the best resolution may just be better error handling for now.
